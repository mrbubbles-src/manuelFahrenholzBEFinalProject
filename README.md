Log in, save book to readlist, get readlist, update user, delete book from readlist and delete your account all work the same as an admin as they do from a user perspective.

The admin role can do a couple extra things though:

`https://be-final-group-project-bookt-jacky-manu.onrender.com/books/adminDeleteUser/:id`

Instead of `:id`, you paste the `_id` of the respective book you want to remove from your list. Similar to the way you delete a book from your readlist, you will see the `_id` inside the response you get when you get your readlist or get all books.

Headers =>

```
